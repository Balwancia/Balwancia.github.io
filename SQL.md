[{'icon': None, 'text': 'Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system. It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables. Introduced in the 1970s, SQL offered two main advantages over older readâ€“write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, i.e., with or without an index. Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements, which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: a data query language, a data definition language, a data control language, and a data manipulation language. The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation, data definition, and data access control.', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL'}, {'icon': 'https://duckduckgo.com/i/8e81ed73.png', 'text': 'SQL A domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a...', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/SQL'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'Squelch A circuit function that acts to suppress the audio output of a receiver in the absence of a...', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/Squelch'}, {'icon': 'https://duckduckgo.com/i/b10f4d16.png', 'text': 'Standard quantum limit A limit on measurement accuracy at quantum scales.', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/Quantum_limit'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'San Carlos Airport (California) San Carlos Airport is two miles northeast of San Carlos, California, in San Mateo County...', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/San_Carlos_Airport_(California)'}]
