[{'icon': None, 'text': 'C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; as of 1997, C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM. C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers, and performance-critical applications.', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'C++ Category', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/C%2B%2B'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'Outline of C++ - The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to C++: C++ is a statically typed, free-form, multi-paradigm, compiled, general-purpose programming language.', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/Outline_of_C%2B%2B'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'Algol programming language family', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/Algol_programming_language_family'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'C++ programming language family', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/C%2B%2B_programming_language_family'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'Programming languages with an ISO standard', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/Programming_languages_with_an_ISO_standard'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'Class-based programming languages', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/Class-based_programming_languages'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'Statically typed programming languages', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/Statically_typed_programming_languages'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'High-level programming languages', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/High-level_programming_languages'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'Object-oriented programming languages', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/Object-oriented_programming_languages'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'Cross-platform software', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/Cross-platform_software'}]
