[{'icon': None, 'text': "JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2024, 98.8% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model. The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.", 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'JavaScript Category', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/JavaScript'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'Object-based programming languages', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/Object-based_programming_languages'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'Web programming', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/Web_programming'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'Programming languages with an ISO standard', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/Programming_languages_with_an_ISO_standard'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'Prototype-based programming languages', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/Prototype-based_programming_languages'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'High-level programming languages', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/High-level_programming_languages'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'Dynamically typed programming languages', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/Dynamically_typed_programming_languages'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'Functional languages', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/Functional_languages'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'Scripting languages', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/Scripting_languages'}, {'icon': None, 'text': 'Cross-platform software', 'topic': None, 'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/c/Cross-platform_software'}]
